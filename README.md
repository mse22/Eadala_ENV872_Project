## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>

The repository contains different aspects and the progress of the final project right from its inception to completion. My goal is to study water quality with the help of the NTL-LTER Lake Datasets provided to us through the Environmental Data Analytics class taught at Nicholas School of the Environment in Spring 2020.

Eutrophication is a phenamenon caused due to excess of nutrients in water and it causes structural changes to the ecosystem in the form of increased production of algae and aquatic plants, depletion of fish species, general deterioration of water quality and other effects that reduce and preclude use. Therefore, it is important to observe and manage lakes and their nutrient loading from time to time to conserve water and other ecosystems dependent on it.

Through this project and its relevant datasets, I hope to understand eutrophication and the correlations between certain elements and nutrients. I intent to answer my research questions through the data wrangling, processing, exploring, and visualization techniques taught in the class.

## Database Information

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

The dataset contains data from studies on several lakes in the North Temperate Lakes District in Wisconsin, USA. Data were collected as part of the Long Term Ecological Research station established by the National Science Foundation. 


## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

<describe the folders contained in the repository, including what type of files they contain>

<describe the formats of files for the various purposes contained in the repository>

<describe your file naming conventions>

The folders contained in the reposity are: 1. "Data" folder further subdivided into "Raw" and "Processed" folders that each contain their relevant csv files, 2. "Code" folder that contains the three R markdown files - Processing & wrangling, data exploration and data analysis 3. Final project files in r markdown and PDF formats. The files are either named as per their description of the data, or their function. For example, raw datasets in the initial stage are named "raw", while any dataset that has departed from the raw dataset is named "processed". The R markdown files are named according to the stages of the analysis. 

## Metadata

Data were collected from the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research website. More information can be found here: https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/about/overview. Data were collected using the Data tool (https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/data).

<For each data file in the repository, describe the data contained in each column. Include the column name, a description of the information, the class of data, and any units associated with the data. Create a list or table for each data file.> 

There are three raw data filed in the repository:
1. 'NTL-LTER_Lake_Carbon_Raw.csv' file: This contains data relevant to dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, particulate organic matter, partial pressure of CO2 and absorbance at 440nm. Samples were collected with a Van Dorn sampler. Organic carbon and absorbance samples were collected from the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion (upper, intermediate, and lower layers of the stratified lakes respectively). Inorganic samples were collected at depths corresponding to 100%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and 1% of surface irradiance, as well as one sample from the hypolimnion. Samples for the partial pressure of CO2 were collected from two meters above the lake surface (air) and just below the lake surface (water). Sampling frequenc varies, and the number of site are 14. The file contains the below column names and their relevant details:
